### Hi, I'm Adam, a data scientist/ ML engineer currently based in London... 

- âœ¨ I previously worked as an astrophysicist for 6 years at MPE, Garching, Germany, completing a PhD and postdoc on ML applications within time domain X-ray astronomy. I also [analysed the multi-wavelength time-series data](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/search/p_=0&q=malyali&sort=date%20desc%2C%20bibcode%20desc) from stellar tidal disruption events, which occur when stars pass too close to supermassive black holes and are torn apart by tidal forces!
