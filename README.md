### Hi, I'm Adam, a data scientist/ ML engineer currently based in London... 

- âœ¨ I previously worked as an astrophysicist for 6 years at MPE, Garching, Germany, completing a PhD and postdoc on ML applications within time domain X-ray astronomy. I also [analysed the multi-wavelength time-series data](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/search/p_=0&q=malyali&sort=date%20desc%2C%20bibcode%20desc) from stellar tidal disruption events, which occur when stars pass too close to supermassive black holes and are torn apart by tidal forces!

- ðŸŒ± Two resolutions for 2024: explore coding in Rust, run a first marathon.

Some projects that I've lead:

1. [XCLASS](https://github.com/amalyali/xclass): automated astronomical X-ray source classification, adapted from work completed in my [PhD thesis](https://edoc.ub.uni-muenchen.de/29876/).

2. [eROSITA data validation](https://github.com/amalyali/erosita_validation): processing scripts for validation of the eROSITA source catalogues.

3. [RadioGalFit](https://github.com/amalyali/RadioGalFit): Radio Galaxy Detection and Characterization in the Visibility Domain using Bayesian Inference. Code developed during Masters thesis, and paper later published in [MNRAS](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/486/2/2695/5432377).
